This is where I share what I'm up to right now. I'll do my best to keep it updated!

## Right now!

- Working remote to Buffalo, NY as a full stack developer for [Life Storage](https://lifestorage.com)
  - TypeScript, Vue, C#, and SQL
- Raising my two sons
- Working on leading my family better spiritually through devotions and prayer
- My wife and I are all moved in to the new house! We're making small improvements already, but are feeling mostly settled in.

This page is all about what I'm doing right now.

## Family

I'm raising 2 boys with my wife in West Michigan. We're enjoying the warm weather and getting outside.

I'm working on leading my family spiritually through prayer and devotions. Setting a good example for our boys is important to my wife and I.

## Money

My wife and I are working on paying down our student loans, saving for a house (hopefully when the market drops), and saving for retirement.

I wouldn't mind retiring earlier than 65, but I still plan to work even if we have the funds by then. I imagine I'll always be working in some capacity. Hopefully by then, I can be very choosy of the work I do.

As time goes on, I want to increase freedom of time and location so I can take trips and see family.

## Career

I successfully [transitioned into a software development career](/about) last year (Apr 2020). I am continuing to learn new technologies and work flows as a contractor for [Meijer](https://meijer.com).

My daily tech stack includes `SQL` and `.NET Core` for Meijer.

## Travel

### Colorado

We traveled to visit my family in Colorado this May. Flying with 2 kids was an adventure! Thankfully they behaved themselves ðŸ˜…

I don't usually get to see my family more than twice/year, but thankfully we keep in touch through email, phone calls, and texts.

### Guy's Trip 2021

I also took a trip with my wife's dad, brother, and grandpa to visit Antietam battleground, Gettysburg battleground, and Harper's Ferry. There's a lot of history there. It was interesting to learn about the battles and other events that took place there.

I am always so thankful for my family and circumstances after thinking about what those men went through in the Civil War.

It was also a great trip to spend time with the guys of the family. I look forward to the next trip with them.

## Hobbies

I have hobbies across multiple areas.

I've been refurbishing hand tools and making new handles for them for several years. I also like using the tools I fix up. I've rehandled several hatchets and axes, cleaned up hand planes, and sharpened the blades on them as well.

I'm fascinated by the late 19th century/early 20th century logging industry and how they cleared forests with man powered tools: axes, crosscut saws, hammers, chisels, etc.

I enjoy coding in my free time as well. This website is built using a static site generator called [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev). It uses JavaScript to pull files together into a website directory that can be hosted online.

Writing and [bullet journaling](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn) are habits that I'm cultivating. I've noticed that sharing and teaching are ways to be perceived as an expert despite experience levels. I want to give my career a leg up while helping others by educating and sharing what I learn.

## Business

I want to build a business someday. But while I figure out what that could be, I'm going to keep sharing what I do. This will serve to:

1. Help me process what I'm thinking about
2. Open the conversation to talk with other people who read about it

[Micropreneurship][micropreneur] is intriguing to me, as well as creating and selling digital products to teach others. I'll continue to think about and explore this topic.

## And Beyond...

That's it for now, I'll do my best to keep this up-to-date!

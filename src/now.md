This is where I share what I'm up to right now. I'll do my best to keep it updated!

## Right now!

- Working remote to Buffalo, NY as a full stack developer for [Life Storage](https://lifestorage.com)
  - TypeScript, Vue, C#, and SQL
- Raising my two sons
- Working on leading my family better spiritually through devotions and prayer
- We've been living in our new house for over a month now. A few big things have been taken care of. We had air conditioning installed, fixed our hot water heater, and we're having gutters installed in December.

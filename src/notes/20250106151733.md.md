I finished crocheting a pair of fingerless gloves to wear while at my computer in the basement so I can still type. They're 100% merino wool so they're warm, but they do make it a little difficult to type. Hopefully I get used to them because I think they turned out pretty well!

These types of gloves remind me of the hobo in *The Polar Express*, but I'm not too concerned about looking fashionable ðŸ˜œ

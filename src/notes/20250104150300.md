This is my first note! I'm hoping to use notes on this website to post fleeting thoughts and ideas rather than waiting to have time to write full posts.

I've been reflecting on how I have a lot of hobbies and interests. It's difficult for me to "pick a lane" so to speak. I end up spending money to get all set up with a new interest, only to jump ship after completing the one project I had in mind. This isn't always the case, but it's happened more times than I care to admit ðŸ˜…

A couple interests have been constants though: woodworking and programming. I'm not necessarily going to stop expanding my interests and trying new things, but it's good to know what I consistantly keep coming back to.

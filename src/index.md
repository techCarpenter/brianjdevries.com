## Hi, I'm Brian DeVries.

Thanks for visiting my site! I [write articles](/blog), [develop software](https://github.com/techcarpenter), and work with hand tools ðŸ”¨.

This website is a way for me to engage with others and share what I learn. My articles cover topics like software, self improvement, and personal experiences.

If you want to see all my writing on a single page, [check out my blog](/blog).

I'm on a journey to find how I can best help others with my skills. In order to do that, I try new things and see what people value most. I continually try new approaches to sharing content and interacting with others.

Some examples of ways I've helped people include creating websites, making [wooden bottle openers][bottle-opener], refurbishing hand tools, and giving feedback on tech projects. If you think I could help you, [please say hello](/contact) ðŸ™‚

Thanks for visiting, I hope you enjoy!

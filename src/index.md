## Hi, I'm Brian DeVries.

This site is a way for me to share what I learn. I [write articles](/blog), [develop software](https://github.com/techcarpenter), and work with hand tools ðŸ”¨.

Some of my projects include building websites, making [wooden bottle openers][bottle-opener], refurbishing hand tools, and giving feedback on tech projects. If you think I could help you, [please get in touch](/contact) ðŸ™‚

See the [Now page](/now) for what I'm currently up to!

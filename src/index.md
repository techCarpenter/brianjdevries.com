## Hi, I'm Brian DeVries.

Thanks for being here! I [write articles](/blog), [develop software](https://github.com/techcarpenter), and work with hand tools.

This website is a way for me to engage with others and share my learnings. My articles cover topics like software, self improvement, and personal experiences.

If you want to see all my writing on a single page, [you can see all my posts here](/blog).

I'm on a journey to find how I can best help others with my skills. In order to do that, I try new things and see what people value most. I continually try new approaches to sharing content and interacting with others.

Some examples of ways I've helped people include creating websites, building wooden products, refurbishing tools, and giving feedback on tech projects. If you think I could help you, [please reach out](/contact).

Thanks for visiting, enjoy!

Brian DeVries

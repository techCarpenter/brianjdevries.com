My oldest son recently turned 5 years old, and like many boys his age, he is very excited about dinosaurs. He can tell you the names of dinosaurs I've never heard of! His attention to detail and the descriptive language he uses to compare them is so fun to hear.

But perhaps the best part is how he's improved his drawings of them. The Tyrannosaurus Rex has never looked sooo good ðŸ˜Ž

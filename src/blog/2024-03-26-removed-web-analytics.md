I removed web analytics from my site. Despite using a more privacy-focused web analytics provider than Google, I realized I was still tracking people who visited my site. And I don't love the idea of doing that.

So I removed the analytics script. No more page view info, no anonymized location data, no trends, no nothin'. And I'm done considering SEO or the algorithms at all when I write.

Websites should be made for people, not search engines and machines. I understand the desire to know the data of page views and search terms. That's why I had analytics in the first place. But if some people who visit my site are blocking trackers, I'm not getting accurate information anyway.

It's never too late to support websites that don't prey on visitors and have a personal touch. Corporate websites have their place, but I want to be a part of the small web.

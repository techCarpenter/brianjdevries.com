No, I don't go to anonymous meetings to support others or to get support. It's not an addiction that people typically think of as destructive like drugs or alcohol. But it does affect me on a daily basis.

## I'm addicted to information

You're probably thinking, _"But information is a good thing, right?"_ Often at the heart of all addictions are things that aren't bad. But when obsessed upon or distorted, they can be debilitating and destructive.

For example, alcohol isn't impairing in modest quantities, but it is when you drink too much. Food is necessary to sustain our bodies, but it causes obesity when you eat too much. Sex is a gift from God, but is destructive when people distort it into pornography.

## Excessive consumption leads to imbalance

With information consumption, the more we consume, the less we produce. The less we produce, the less fulfilled we feel so we consume more.

The internet and cell phones have put more information in our pocket than we can fathom. If we don't limit our intake, we can quickly become overwhelmed by the shear volume available.

With a phone or computer nearby, I cannot contain my impulse to search for answers to my latest query. Social media lures me in. The links throughout an article beg me to keep reading. To go further down the rabbit hole. You know the feeling. _"What?! I've been on YouTube/Instagram/Twitter/Facebook/etc. for an hour?!"_

While I hope that isn't the norm for you, I know how common the struggle is. It doesn't feel good when you realize you burned through productive time like that.

So where do we go from here?

I've been actively minimizing distractions for a year or two. I'll share some of the tactics that have helped me consume less.

### 1. App time limits

Most phones now offer the ability to set time limits for specific apps right within the setting. If that isn't the case, there's an app called StayFocused that can set time limits for apps as well.

### 2. Website time limits

I found a way to set time limits on websites that are distracting. There's a Chrome/Firefox extension call Leechblock. I maintain a list of distracting sites and then those sites are blocked by the extension once the time limit is reached.

### 3. Turn off notifications for distracting apps

Managing app settings and turning off notifications for distracting apps keeps you from opening them unless you have a reason to. I turn off notifications for most apps that I don't want bugging me.

### 4. Notification batching

Notification batching is a newer tactic I've tried. This way notifications are still visible, but they are intercepted and delivered at set intervals. I set mine for 8:00AM, 12:00PM, 5:00PM, and 9:00PM.

I'm currently using Spren on android. I'm not sure if there is an option on iPhone.

### 5. Add friction to get to distracting apps

If there's an app on my home screen that I mindlessly waste time on, I remove it from the main screen so it's harder to get to. If that doesn't help, I hide it. The most distracting ones are uninstalled.

### 6. Put your phone in the other room

My phone is where most of my distractions come from. If I really need to focus on something or someone, I put the phone in the other room. I'll still hear phone calls, but then I'm less likely to check when notifications do come through.

### 7. If-Then Planning

I've already talked about [If this, then that](/cold-showers-and-habit-building#if-then-planning) before, but having a planned exit from distractions can help. Something like, "If I get distracted, I will close the distracting app" can be all you need to snap out of a distracting situation.

### 8. Time box when you allow yourself to get distracted

Allowing yourself time to get distracted is important. I know I need breaks where my mind is allowed to wander. The important thing is to limit those times and respect the limits.

### 9. Get someone to help hold you accountable

My wife and I think it's important to stay off our phones when our kids are awake as much as possible so we are giving them the attention they deserve. Having each other as accountability partners makes that easier to accomplish. Finding someone who wants to reduce their distractions as well can be a great way to reach that goal.

### 10. Reward yourself when you succeed

My last tactic is to reward yourself when you do well. Set a goal for avoiding distractions and information overload. If you achieve your goal, have a reward in mind.

## It's a process

These are just some of the tactics that I've used and continue to use. I am not as distraction free as I'd like to be, but I have improved. Staying aware of where my time is going will allow me to improve more.

I still have to add distracting sites to my list and prune the apps on my phone occasionally. It's a constant process in this age of information, but a worthwhile one. I will continue to guard my time so I can focus on the important things. You should too.

For the last 6 years, I've had a bit of an entrepreneurial spirit. I like trying new things, and it's fun to make money from my efforts as well. Over the years, I've made money from woodworking, programming, graphic design, and more. Now I've found another fun avenue to explore: _custom stickers_.

Everyone likes stickers, right? They're fun, easy to store and distribute, and economical. Stickers are a good way to share a message or promote a brand and customers love them. I've been working to help small businesses promote themselves with their own custom stickers.

Whether customers already have a design or need one, I have been able to help! Here is the sticker for my first customer. He already had a logo so I took care of the printing for him.

After that, my second order came from a friend who wanted a custom design. For this design, if you know, you know ðŸ˜›

Beyond printing stickers in bulk for customers, I have been dabbling with some designs of my own. I haven't printed any of my own designs yet, but I'm planning to once I decide on a worthy design. I think it'd be cool to have a custom sticker for this website.

<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;flex-wrap: wrap;justify-content: space-around;">

  <img style="margin: 1rem auto;" alt="Barn quilt image of woven red and blue" src="https://assets.vries.land/wovenBarnQuilt.jpeg" width=300>

</div>

I'm just getting started, but it's been really fun so far to bring a few ideas to life. [Shoot me an email](mailto:devriesdecals@gmail.com) if you'd like some custom stickers printed for a business, an event, or just for fun!

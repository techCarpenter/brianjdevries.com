For the last 6 years, I've had a bit of an entrepreneurial spirit. I like trying new things, and it's fun to make money from my efforts as well. Over the years, I've made money from woodworking, programming, graphic design, and more. Now I've found another fun avenue to test out: _custom stickers_.

So everyone likes stickers, right? They're fun, easy to store and distribute, and economical. Stickers are a good way to share a message or promote a brand and customers love them. I've been working to help small businesses promote themselves with their own custom stickers.

Whether someone already has a design or needs one, I am able to help. Here is the sticker for my first customer. He already had a logo so I took care of the printing for him.

After that, my second order came from a friend who wanted a custom design. If you know, you know ðŸ˜›

I want to be consistently moving forward towards freedom. Financial freedom, time freedom, location freedom. It will not be without its challenges, but I think it's worthy to strive for.

I need to get into a daily routine or schedule, but my second son is about to be born (my wife is getting induced **TODAY**). I'm not sure how that is going to affect the process quite yet.

But if consistency is what I'm trying to achieve, a daily schedule/routine will help ensure that happens.

Of course, Hannah and I need to be on the same page about what I want my schedule to be. My goals and routines can't be separate from her. When I change my daily routine, it affects my family.

I came up with a starting schedule yesterday. It will change to adjust to the needs of my family with the newborn, but it's a good starting place.

| Start Time |     |                    | Item                                        |
| :--------: | :-: | :----------------: | :------------------------------------------ |
|   4:45AM   |  :  |         🌄         | Wake up                                     |
|   5:00AM   |  :  |     💻 <br> ✍️     | Programming & <br> Writing                  |
|   6:30AM   |  :  |     👨‍👦‍👦 <br> 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦     | Get kids up, then <br> Family time          |
|   7:30AM   |  :  |         👨‍💻         | Day job                                     |
|   4:30PM   |  :  |     🥘 <br> 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦     | Dinner & <br> Family time                   |
|   7:30PM   |  :  | 🛌 <br> 🚶 <br> 🚿 | (Kids in bed), then <br> Ruck & <br> Shower |
|   8:30PM   |  :  |         💑         | Wife time                                   |
|   9:30PM   |  :  |         🛌         | Get ready for bed                           |
|   9:45PM   |  :  |         😴         | Sleep                                       |

I've been getting about 7 hours of sleep at night for a couple weeks now and I'm still fresh. I'll have less some nights with the baby, but 7 is my goal.

I have plans to build a web app to help myself analyze where our debt is at. It'll help plan how to pay them off the fastest, track how much progress we've made, and compare other changes.

Since we're not the only ones in debt, I think an app like that could help a lot of people.

- It can help get their debts under control and reduce the overwhelm.
- It can save people money 💰.
- It can encourage them to keep making progress.
- It can remind them to celebrate milestones 🎉.
- It can give them back their _financial freedom_.

I'm looking forward to working on this project. It'll be challenging and useful. But since we'll be having a baby today or tomorrow, I probably won't make too much progress this week.

The next time I write, I'll be a father of 2 boys! See you then.

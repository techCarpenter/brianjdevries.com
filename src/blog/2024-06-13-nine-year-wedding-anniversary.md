To my lovely, beautiful wife Hannah.

Happy Anniversary Hannah! ‚ù§ I can't imagine living life without you.

We've laughed together, cried together, prayed together, and so much more. Thank you for being a constant through the ups and downs of life.

When we got married half way into college, I don't think either of us could have predicted just how much God would bless us.

Our three sons definitely test our patience at times, but they've also brought immeasurable joy into our lives.

I have student debt and wanted to create a way to plan and track my progress paying it off. Most other solutions only create a projection, but I'm working to make an app that keeps up with you.

#### Tech

- Implemented Frontend with [Vue][vue] (including Vuex and Vue-router)
  - Code base written primarily with [Typescript][typescript]
  - [Plotly.js][plotlyjs] package for charts
  - [Tailwind CSS][tailwind] used for styles
- Data is persisted in [Firestore database][firestore]
- Implemented user authentication with [Firebase Auth][firebase-auth]
- Deployed on [Netlify][netlify]

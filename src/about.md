## A bit about me

Growing up, I was able to learn a lot about fixing, building, and making things from my mom, dad, uncles, and grandpas.

If it involved using your hands, you could convince me to give it a try! I learned things like crocheting, baking, woodworking, farming, plumbing, and auto repair.

My grandpa even hired me during the summers from 7th-12th grade to help him around the farm. If you want to learn a lot and work hard, ask a farmer for a job, ha!

From there, I went to college in Grand Rapids, MI for a degree in electrical engineering. I did pretty well in school up to that point, but had to try much harder in college (not surprising, right?).

Ultimately, my love of technology and learning led me to the land of programming, which is now what I do full-time.

My whole life has been learning new things. I continue to learn new things and hope to inspire others to continue learning as well. But in all things, I strive to honor Jesus and praise Him for the gifts he has given me to share with others.
